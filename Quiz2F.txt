Why is the system unit not working properly?

Observation:
	
	The fuse of the power supply was blown resulting to failure 
for us to check other parts especially the motherboard. The CPU fan
is functional but we observed that the system unit is dusty and the 
cables are old enough to break anytime.

Solution:
	We recommend:
		-  Buy new fuse of the power supply.
		-  Buy new power supply.
		-  Buy a new set of system unit.
